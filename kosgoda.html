      <h2>About the hatchery</h2>
      <p>Kosgoda Hatchery is a renowned sea turtle conservation project located in the coastal town of Kosgoda, Sri Lanka. 
        Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests. They are the Olive Ridleys,
         Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills.
         The hatchery was established in the late 1980s as a response to the declining sea turtle populations and the increasing threats they faced along the coastal areas of Kosgoda.
         The hatchery began as a small-scale grassroots project driven by dedicated individuals and volunteers. Their major goal was to rescue sea turtle eggs from dangerous nesting places and transport them to a secure hatching area. 
         To increase its influence and contribute to larger conservation programs, the hatchery has collaborated with government agencies, non-profit groups, and researchers. The Kosgoda Hatchery has also played an important role in promoting
          awareness about the need of sea turtle conservation among local communities, schools, and visitors. Kosgoda Hatchery is now a symbol of effective community-driven conservation initiatives.
