      <h2>About the hatchery</h2>
      <p>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project is a renowned tourist attraction in Bentota. The gorgeous golden sands that entice you to our island also serve as an alluring nesting site for numerous endangered turtle species, 
        ranging from the Olive Ridley to the Leatherback turtle.
        The hatchery serves as a sanctuary for wounded or sick turtles, offering them a place to heal. Skilled veterinarians and dedicated caregivers work diligently to rehabilitate these turtles, bringing them back to health 
        before reintroducing them into their natural environment. The hatchery also acts as a nesting site for female turtles, sheltering their nests and ensuring the safe incubation of eggs until the hatchlings emerge. 
        Visitors may participate in educational tours and interactive workshops to learn about the life cycle of turtles, their ecological value, and the continuous challenges they face on a daily basis. You start on a journey of exploration,
         compassion, and hope when you visit the Bentota Turtle Hatchery.</p>
