      <h2>Type of donations</h2>
      <p>Donations are essential for the operation of turtle hatcheries
         in Sri Lanka. These hatcheries work hard to protect endangered sea turtles, but they require financial assistance to meet 
         their costs. Donations assist with things like facility upkeep, turtle health care, research, and education. They also assist
          with the purchase of essential goods such as nesting materials and turtle food. This is why your donation immediately supports the operation of these hatcheries 
          and the protection of sea turtles in Sri Lanka's coastal areas.
