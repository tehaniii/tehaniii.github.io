     <p>Sri Lanka has a diversified sea turtle population, with five of the world's seven sea turtle species present in its seas. These turtles are a vital element of Sri Lanka's marine environment, helping to keep the ecosystem healthy and balanced. They help to manage the
       population of their victims, such as jellyfish and sponges, by servine as an indicator of the health of the marine environment.<br></p>

    <h3>WHY SEA TURTLES?</h3><br><br>
    <p>Sea turtles play a crucial role in the health of our marine ecosystem. 
            However, it is disturbing to learn that 6 of the world's 7 species of sea turtles are in risk of extinction.
             This stresses on how essential it is to save these beautiful creatures and their environments.Here are just a 
             few examples of how crucial sea turtles are to preserving our marine ecosystems:
          </p>
          
      <ul>
        <li>turtles are significant scavengers who consume dead and rotting marine life. By doing so, the ecosystem is cleaned up and hazardous bacterial growth is prevented.</li>
        <li>In order to stimulate the growth of vegetation and other species, sea turtles transfer nutrients from the ocean to the beaches where they lay their eggs.</li>     
    <li>By sea turtles consuming sea sponges, they help maintain the health of the coral reefs by minimizing the threat 
      of the coral reefs being crowded out.</li>
    </ul>

   
 <p> In order ensure the survival of these beautiful animals and the preservation of our seas, 
     it is very essential that we take action.Sea turtle decline might have a huge effect on the 
     marine environment as a whole since sea turtles are veryÂ important indicators of the health of our seas.

      outreach, we strive to accomplish this aim.We work to advance sustainable practices and protect turtle nesting beaches</p>
  <br><p>
    In addition, we are committed to raising public awareness of the threats to sea turtles and the need to conserve them.
   We are devoted to the preservation and defense of sea turtles and their natural environments here at our turtle hatchery. Our goal is to offer a secure habitat for sea turtle eggs to develop
      and mature in before reintroducing them to the ocean once they are healthy enough to thrive there. Additionally, we want to spread knowledge and increase awareness of the dangers that sea 
      turtles face, such as habitat loss, pollution, and poaching. We think that by joining together, we can make a positive impact on sea turtle survival and the condition of our seas. In order 
      to help us continue our efforts to safeguard these incredible animals, we thus invite you to support our hatchery and donate to our cause.
